I'm **Shiyuan Feng**, a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at [Turing Class](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/research/turing_program/introduction1/index.htm), [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/).

I spent a wonderful semester at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) as an exchange student, where I had the opportunity to work with [Prof. David P. Woodruff](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dwoodruf/) on topics in streaming algorithms and numerical linear algebra.

I enjoyed competitive programming. Our team won a second place in [47th ICPC World Final](https://icpc.global/) in Luxor, Egypt. Here is a [photo](https://p-b-p-b.github.io/assets/img/icpc_wf.jpg) of our team.
